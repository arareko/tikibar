This is more of a brain-dump of where we're going. It will hopefully be
organized more over time.

Get tikibar ready for opensourcing
----------------------------------

- Modify the data format to be parsed more automtically
- Create a plugin system for data type processing
- Create a plugin system for the data panels
- Create a test project in the repo for testing/demoing tikibar

Future Improvements
-------------------

- Standalone electron app for watching requests as they go by
- WSGI middleware that could be used with non-Django apps
